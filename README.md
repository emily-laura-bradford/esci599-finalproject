# esci599-finalproject
Final project for ESCI 599: App Development

## Purpose

This Shiny app is designed to visualize wildlife sightings in Bellingham, WA. It is very much a work in progress. Ideally, when the app is finished, users will be able to filter sightings to neighborhoods and parks of interest, as well as filter to taxa of interest.

The app currently relies on data that I have not yet shared in this repo, but I will eventually (once it's cleaned and finalized.)

A live version of the app can be found here: https://emilybradford.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/
