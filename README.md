# Bellingham Urban Wildlife Viewer
Final project for ESCI 599: App Development

## Purpose

This Shiny app is designed to visualize wildlife sightings in Bellingham, WA. It is very much a work in progress. 

For the app to run correctly, you must download the "Data" and "www" folders and extract both of them in the same project folder as Bradford_FinalProject.R

A live version of the app can be found here: https://emilybradford.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/
